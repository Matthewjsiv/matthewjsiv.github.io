Autonomous motorsports aim to replicate
the human racecar driver with software and sensors.
As in traditional motorsports, Autonomous Racing Ve-
hicles (ARVs) are pushed to their handling limits in
multi-agent scenarios at extremely high (â‰¥ 150mph)
speeds. This Operational Design Domain (ODD) presents
unique challenges across the autonomy stack. Standard
autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on High Definition (HD)
Maps, that provide information such as lanes, right of
way information, and more, to simplify many problems.
For ARVs, an HD map includes information about
the race track, including its boundaries and banking,
which the autonomy software can exploit to improve
performance. In this project, we created a pipeline to
take in noisy sensor LiDAR data and GPS information
in order to create an HD map for an ARV, automatically
building a globally registered pointcloud and extracting
the relevant information.
