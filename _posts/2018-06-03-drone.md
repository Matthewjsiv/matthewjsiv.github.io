I wrote a python script for the Tello drone so it can track and follow you in order to keep you in the frame. It uses a python port of the posenet model I use in my pose-evaluator demo (which you can see if you scroll down) to
	 predict key points on your body. It then uses the relationships between the different points to calculate an error value which it feeds into basic PID controllers (one for each type of movement). This allows it to rotate, move up/down, and move forward/backward as it follows you.
	 It clearly isn't perfect yet, but I am currently working on expanding it by fine tuning the PID and implementing other new features such as different tracking behaviors, as well as rebuilding it using ROS.
 You can see the code and more info <a href="https://github.com/Matthewjsiv/Person-Tracking-Tello-Drone" target="_blank"> <b>here</b></a>.
