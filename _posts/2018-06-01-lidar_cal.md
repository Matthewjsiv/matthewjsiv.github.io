When working with multiple sensors that provide spatial information, one needs
good calibration between them so that their outputs can be aligned in one common
frame. One common challenge is calibrating the extrinsics between two lidar sensors.
Doing this process manually is tedious, error-prone, and sometimes involves extra
materials. Instead, this can be done automatically by taking advantage of structure in
the environment. I did this by fitting planes to the outputs of the individual sensors,
and then finding the transform between those planes. This process can be done with
a single scan from each sensor, provided that both can see three independent planes that sufficiently constrain the problem.
